To create a new verification file (clean state), use the -c option when running the file:

./IDS.sh -c

To check the clean state for any intrusion, use the -v option when running the file:

./IDS.sh -v

Categories of Changes:

Permissions: Any file / directory whose permissions have been changed.

File Changed: Any file / directory whose modifiers (file links, owner, group, size, last date and time modified) or whose contents have been changed. A file which is 'renamed' is treated as being a file which was created and deleted - which is intentional, as within the real world this could happen, and misinterpreting a file which has been created / deleted with a file that has been renamed is very dangerous.

File Deleted: Any file / directory which has been deleted since the clean state was established.

File Created: Any file / directory which has been deleted since the clean state was established.
